  "pr_body": "This PR introduces a new standard teams page to display our team members. The page is designed to be visually appealing and provides a template for showcasing individual profiles.\n\n**Changes:**\n- Added a new route and component for the teams page.\n- Implemented a basic layout for displaying team members.\n- Populated the page with placeholder team member data, including generated Aryan and Nordic names, random mobile numbers, emails, and other relevant information.\n\n**Review Notes:**\n- The current team member data is placeholder and will need to be replaced with actual team information.\n- Styling and responsiveness can be further refined."
