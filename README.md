## Features

*   **Modern Stack:** Built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript for a powerful and type-safe development experience.
*   **Styling:** Utilizes Tailwind CSS (or similar, based on `postcss.config.mjs`) for utility-first styling, enabling rapid UI development.
*   **Linting & Formatting:** Enforced with ESLint and Prettier (implied by `eslint.config.mjs`) to maintain code quality and consistency.
*   **Optimized Performance:** Leverages Next.js features like automatic code splitting, image optimization, and server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG) for superior performance.
*   **Clear Structure:** Organized with a logical folder structure for easy navigation and maintainability.
